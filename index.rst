	#### Comment: This manual has multiple pages. The table of contents assumes
	you have an additional page called 'Platform Dashboard/Landing Page' with
	content located in 'step1.rst'. Copy 'step2.rst' as many times as needed
	for each major feature you using, and increment the number in your filename.
	Finally, make sure that the last major feature uses the 'step3.rst' template,
	as it has slightly different formatting to end the document.
	Edit these titles and filenames as needed. Finally use 'faq.rst' to
	create your list of Frequently Asked Questions. ####

.. #### Comment: Each platform should have a quick slide show or possibly video
   tour. Slide shows should be HTML5, videos from YouTube
